Consider your comparison group. Are you comparing yourself to all of humanity? To people who had the same background as you? To a group of people with similar credentials? You can easily make yourself seem mediocre by adjusting your comparison group as your abilities grow, so make sure you're comparing yourself to the right set of people. Most of the time when we think we're mediocre, it's just because we're comparing ourselves with people who have had more time or trying to achieve a standard of perfection that few or no people actually achieve.
For example, I am an Ironman and ultramarathoner, but I don't consider myself very fit because my Ironman time isn't very good (12:57) - and see, even that is actually not true, it's well into the top 50%. I'm comparing myself to all other Ironman finishers (worldwide thanks to the internet), rather than to all other people or other triathletes, and discounting people who are older, who started off in less good shape, etc. Virtually by definition I'm going to be below average. And if I got into better shape, I'd think of myself as "sort of fast I guess, but I still have never won my age group", and then if I won my age group, I'd think "but I still haven't won a race".
All that said, a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. Figure out what you want to do and try to do it. You will probably fail. Figure out why you failed and fix that or work around it. Repeat. Eventually you will achieve your goal. It may take years and tons of effort, but almost any goal is achievable.
